Object oriented programming
===========================

#####1. Does JavaScript support OOP?

Yes and No. JavaScript was not developed to be centered around OOP development (like Java, C#, etc).
However, JavaScript supports something called Prototypes, which allow us to emulate OOP behavior pretty well.

Prototype-based programming can be seen as a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not present, 
and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is accomplished through a process of decorating 
existing objects which serve as prototypes. 
This model is also known as class-less, prototype-oriented, or instance-based programming.
